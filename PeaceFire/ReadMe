More than half of all civil wars that ended between 1945-2022 later resumed. Expanding
on previous research, this study theorizes, disaggregates and assesses how the nature of
war termination shapes the likelihood that conflicts will recur. We conjecture that wars
are more likely to repeat after ceasefires than after peace agreements and military
victories. We identify three mechanisms that render ceasefires more likely to reignite
wars relative to other outcomes: rearmament, alliance formation, and nation-state
building. Deploying Cox models and Random Survival Forests on global data covering
all civil war terminations and recurrences since WW2, we find strong empirical support.
Drawing on original interviews, we explore the theorized mechanisms in the ongoing
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Although intended to promote peace, our results suggest that
ceasefires make conflict much more likely to reoccur, while intensifying and prolonging
the hostilities. We conclude with implications for the management of recurring conflicts.
