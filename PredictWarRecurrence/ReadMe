Previous research on civil war recurrence has predominantly relied on standard survival models like Cox proportional hazards to identify statistically significant predictors. While this Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) approach is crucial for theoretical advancements, it has notable deficiencies in forecasting civil war recurrence. Chief among these are that identified significant predictors do not always enhance model predictions and that the lack of partitioning data into training and testing sets increases the risk of overfitting, resulting in models that perform inadequately on new, unseen data. To mitigate these issues, this study incorporates machine learning algorithms specialized for survival analysis. These algorithms are assessed for their ability to improve the predictability of civil war recurrence. The study employs five groups of survival-based machine learning algorithms, including 1)penalized Cox regression with Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net penalties; 2)Random Survival Forest and its adaptation using Maximally Selected Rank Statistics; 3)Survival Support Vector Machines; 4)neural networks like Cox-nnet and N-MTLR (Neural Multi-Task Logistic Regression); and 5)boosting approaches such as CoxBoost, GLMBoost, and XGBoost. Initially, boosting and Random Survival Forest methods are utilized to determine variable importance in the prediction of civil war recurrence. Subsequently, a foundational model incorporating population and GDP data is established. The model is then incrementally augmented with additional predictors identified from civil war recurrence literature to measure how each predictor contributes to the model’s concordance index (C-index)—a metric employed in survival analysis. This study provides two fundamental contributions to the field: it develops predictive models for civil war recurrence; and it examines the significant potential of employing survival analysis-oriented machine learning algorithms—traditionally used in medical research—for analyzing right-censored data within the domain of conflict studies.
